# Purpose of This Repo

This repo contains my submission for the Udacity STEDI Human Balance Analytics project. 

## Folder Structure

The repo consists of 3 main folders containing submissions for landing, trusted and curated zones. These folders are subsequently separated into folders for Athena screenshots and SQL/Python scripts.

### Submission for step_trainer_trusted count

The screenshot for count of step_trainer_trusted is 13920 vs expected 14460. I believe there is an error with the rubric as I got the correct count for machine_learning_curated (34437 rows). 

I have submitted the count of 13920 as per advice in the following Udacity Knowledge thread: https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/1068535
